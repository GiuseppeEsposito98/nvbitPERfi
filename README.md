   * Host CPU: x86_64
   * OS: Linux
   * GCC version: >= 5.3.0
   * CUDA version: >= 8.0 && <= 11.x
   * CUDA driver version: <= 510.85
   * nvcc version for tool compilation >= 10.2
   * CMake >= 3.16
   * python >= 3.7   
   * pandas==1.3.4
 
# Getting started on a Linux x86\_64 PC
```bash
# NVBit-v1.5.5
wget https://github.com/NVlabs/NVBit/releases/download/1.5.5/nvbit-Linux-x86_64-1.5.5.tar.bz2
tar xvfj nvbit-Linux-x86_64-1.5.5.tar.bz2
cd nvbit_release/tools/

# NVbitPERfi 
git clone https://github.com/divadnauj-GB/nvbitPERfi.git
cd nvbitPERfi
find . -name "*.sh" | xargs chmod +x

# Prepare the benchmarks  
cd test-apps/
python3 configure_real_workloads.py
```
# How to use this framework?

If you want to execute the IOC error model for all apps that were used in the paper; run the following script. Previously during the tool setup the [configure_real_workloads.py](https://github.com/divadnauj-GB/nvbitPERfi/blob/main/test-apps/configure_real_workloads.py) script already configured all the application benchmarchs. 

```bash
export FAULT_MODE=ICOC
# for each benchmark in test-apps
for bench in accl bfs cfd darknet_v3 gaussian gemm hotspot lava LeNet lud mergesort nw quicksort VectorAdd; do
   ./runPERfi.sh $bench $FAULT_MODE> log_$bench.log
done
```

If you want to use any other error model just change the **FAULT_MODE** variable whith one of the following descriptors:
```console
[IAT, IAW, IAC, WV, IRA, IMS, IMD, IAL, ICOC, IIO]
```

Assuming that the tool and its dependencies have been appropriately installed and configured, to run the NVBitPERfi for a single benchmark such as GEMM with IOC fault model, execute the following command:

```bash
export FAULT_MODE=ICOC
./runPERfi.sh gemm $FAULT_MODE> gemm.log
```
After completing the fault injection procedure, the results can be extracted by running the parsers to generate a CSV file containing the parsed fault injection details. It is important to note that each parser has configuration variables in its first lines that must be set prior to execution. The following command can be used to parse the data:

```bash
cd scripts/parsers/
# - Set the configuration variables
# inside the parser and execute it
python3 parse_pf_injections.py
# Results will be stored in the path
# set in the OUTPUT_PARSED_FILE var
```
